# LTC2954 On Off Emulator
How to request a graceful shutdown of your microcontroller project.

The Linear Technology **LTC2954** device allows a single push button on *and* off of your microcontroller (via a P-channel MOSFET). Additionally it can request an emergency shutdown via a user-configurable delay by pressing and holding the aforementioned button for several seconds.

Here's how to emulate the first two features using our previously used (video #123) Auto Shufoff dual MOSFET circuitry with just a coufple of extra components.
